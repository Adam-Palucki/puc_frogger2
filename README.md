# puc_frogger2
PUC Frogger 2 - simple pygame zero game.
2020 Adam Pa≈Çucki

Try to move frog cross the highway. Watch out - there are 12 traffic lanes. Cars are going really fast.
You can set difficulty level if it is too hard.


The game was created during teaching 11 years old children to program in python. Example code showing usage of basic 
python semantics and data structures. I decided to add elements of object-oriented programming (OOP). 
I think it's appropriate to learn OOP from very beginning. I place many comments for educational purposes.
The code is easy to explain and understand. You can change many parameters.  
Feel free to experiment. Have fun.
